# arvis-plist-converter

* Convert Alfred workflow's `info.plist` to `arvis-workflow.json` of [Arvis](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis)

* Alfred's `info.plist` is not an open format, so it can be changed at any time.

* This means some parts of this package may not work as per Alfred's update.

* Not all nodes are supported for conversion.
